# NightSkyEngine

Night Sky Engine is a free and open source fighting game framework made in Unreal Engine 5. It is designed to be powerful yet easy to learn, and can be used to make 2D and 2.5D fighting games.

It requires Unreal Engine 5.7. 

This branch is intended to target higher-end machines, such as consoles and high-end PCs. If you're looking for lower fidelity visuals, please use the `lowend` branch.
