About Night Sky Engine
===================

## What is Night Sky Engine written in?
Night Sky Engine uses high-level visual scripting powered by Unreal Engine's Blueprint system, giving those with less programming experience the ability to create their own characters. If this scripting isn't enough for your needs, the native C++ backend can be edited freely to extend functionality.

## What are some key features of Night Sky Engine?
Using the Blueprint system and exposed native functions, Night Sky Engine allows for very in-depth control of character states. States are quite robust, allowing the creator to control frame data, set animations, create timers, move objects, and more.

Night Sky Engine also allows for both 2D sprite-based characters using Paper2D and 3D skeletal characters. As an added bonus, there's support for both traditionally animated 3D characters and the Arc System Works style of animated 3D characters.

One of the most important features included is rollback netcode using GGPO. Stable netplay across the world is possible thanks to this.

## Should I download now, or wait for later?

After over 3 years of development, Night Sky Engine is finally ready for use! Feel free to download it right now and start making the fighting game of your dreams.
